# Exploring the Impacts of Music Therapy
Tiauna Dorsey & Roselyanne Cepero Santos

## Describe the Selected Topic and Reasoning behind Selection
The central topic of this project is music therapy, the use of music to improve an individual’s stress, mood, and overall mental health. While the authors were sharing available datasets and potential studies of interests, they wound up sharing their experiences about being a bootcamp student and realized that they both relished listening to music––not just for leisure, but also as study and relaxation tools. They noticed that listening to music helped them relax better so that they can maintain longer periods of focus while working on assignments. After some digging, they found a dataset which collected music tastes and self-reported mental states. The authors are investigating whether one’s music taste and how frequently those genres are listened to have an impact on an individual’s self-reported mental state.

## A Description of the Data
This dataset was built by Catherine Rasgaitis, a computer science student at the University of Washington. The source data stored in the CSV file was previously raw data from Google form. The goal of the MxMH dataset is to uncover any connections between a person's musical preferences and their mental well-being, as well as to offer insights into the relationship between music and the mind.

## Research Questions
#### Demographics (Table 1)
* How do the reported levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD vary among different age groups? 
* What are the age ranges for each favorite genre?
#### Specific Illnesses (Table 2)
* What are the average hours per day spent listening to music for individuals based on their anxiety score? 
* Is there a correlation between hours spent listening to music and self-reported depression?
* How does the frequency of listening to different genres (e.g. pop, R&B, rap, rock, video game music) relate to self-reported insomnia?
#### Music Listening Tools (Table 3)
* How do the reported effects of music listening differ among individuals who play instruments and those who do not?
#### Machine Learning Question
* Using the K-means unsupervised machine learning model, can we predict an individual’s mental health state based on how frequently they listen to certain music genres?
