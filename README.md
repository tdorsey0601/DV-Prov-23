# Exploring the Impacts of Music Therapy
Tiauna Dorsey & Roselyanne Cepero Santos

## Describe the Selected Topic and Reasoning behind Selection
The central topic of this project is music therapy, the use of music to improve an individual’s stress, mood, and overall mental health. While the authors were sharing available datasets and potential studies of interests, they wound up sharing their experiences about being a bootcamp student and realized that they both relished listening to music––not just for leisure, but also as study and relaxation tools. They noticed that listening to music helped them relax better so that they can maintain longer periods of focus while working on assignments. After some digging, they found a dataset which collected music tastes and self-reported mental states. The authors are investigating whether one’s music taste and how frequently those genres are listened to have an impact on an individual’s self-reported mental state.
