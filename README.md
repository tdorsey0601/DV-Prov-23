# Exploring the Impacts of Music on Mental Health
Tiauna Dorsey & Roselyanne Cepero Santos

## Describe the Selected Topic and Reasoning behind Selection
The central topic of this project is music therapy, the use of music to improve an individual’s stress, mood, and overall mental health. While the authors were sharing available datasets and potential studies of interests, they wound up sharing their experiences about being a bootcamp student and realized that they both relished listening to music––not just for leisure, but also as study and relaxation tools. They noticed that listening to music helped them relax better so that they can maintain longer periods of focus while working on assignments. After some digging, they found a dataset which collected music tastes and self-reported mental states. The authors are investigating whether one’s music taste and how frequently those genres are listened to have an impact on an individual’s self-reported mental state.

## A Description of the Data
This dataset was built by Catherine Rasgaitis, a computer science student at the University of Washington. The source data stored in the CSV file was previously raw data from Google form. The goal of the MxMH dataset is to uncover any connections between a person's musical preferences and their mental well-being, as well as to offer insights into the relationship between music and the mind.

* What are the age ranges for each favorite genre?
* Please see below to view the age ranges for each favorite genre. Pop and Rock had the greatest number of outliers. Rap had the greatest age range, from 13 to 89 years old. Classical music had an age range from 12 to 80. Country music was from 14 to 70. EDM had 15 to 49. Folk was from 13 to 49. Gospel was from  18 to 71, with the oldest interquartile range of 57 to 68. Hip hop was from 15 to 58. Jazz had 14 to 61. K Pop was from 14 to 30. Latin was the shortest range, since it also had the least number of counts, from 17 to 18. Lofi was 13 to 33. Metal had 15 to 48. Pop was 10 to 74. R&B was 14 to 73. Rock had 13 to 72. Finally, Videogames was 13 to 43.

#### Specific Illnesses
* What are the average hours per day spent listening to music for individuals based on their anxiety score?
On average, music is listened to by the participants at least 2.8 hours a day, the lowest y-value on the chart. Depending upon the anxiety score however, the results demonstrated that there was not an association between displaying more symptoms of anxiety and whether music was listened to more or less. This is cemented by the fact that the average hours per day fluctuated between 3.2 and 4 hours, the data was not trending in one direction. It is relevant to note, however, that after having an anxiety score of 7.5, the average hours of listening to music per day plateaued above 3.8 hours.

* How does the frequency of listening to different genres (e.g. pop, R&B, rap, rock, video game music) relate to self-reported anxiety, insomnia, OCD and depression?

Every listener of all ages recorded some type of improvement except for Rock, Video Game Music, Pop, Rap and Classical. These five genres showed a decrease when listeners recorded their mental state.

#### Music Listening Tools
* How do the reported effects of music listening differ among individuals who play instruments and those who do not?
There were three possible responses for the music effects column. The options were whether music improved, worsened, or had no effect on an individual's mental state. 81.03% of instrumentalists reported that music improved their mental state, whereas only 71.40% of noninstrumentalists agreed. While both groups shared a similar percentage that music worsened their mental state, there was a higher percentage of people unimpacted at all in the noninstrumental group than the instrumental group.

#### Machine Learning Question
* Using the K-means unsupervised machine learning model, can we predict an individual’s mental health state based on how frequently they listen to certain music genres?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110437574/216779110-de84bbe4-f838-4129-8d21-2911df790351.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110437574/216779123-dbbe5972-e1b6-4b8e-a3dc-a2c738a81f84.png)

Utilizing the K-means machine learning model, we clustered the different frequencies at which each genre was listened to and their self-reported mental state. The frequencies were on a categorical scale, "Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", and "Very frequently". The self-reported mental states for Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia were all on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 meaning that one experienced symptoms of either illness on a frequent basis. While the K-means model is useful for visualizing groupings, this model cannot exactly explain the reason behind groups being clustered. For example, while we did find that the frequency of listening to certain genres influenced an individual's mental state more than other genres, this model cannot guarantee that may be the sole reason behind our outcome. This can demonstrate however, that there is a relationship between the values. 

Since we were given string values for the music genre frequencies, they had to be converted to float values so that we could use a K-means model. After they were transformed to a scale of 0 to 3, we found that listening to Hip Hop, Pop, R&B, Rap, and Lofi at a "Very Frequently" basis were the most meaningful components in relation to one's mental state.
